Computer Network Architecture:-

Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. 
Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.

The two types of network architectures are used:-

1. Peer-To-Peer network
2. Client/Server network

Peer-To-Peer network:-

1. Peer-To-Peer network is a network in which all the computers are linked together with equal privilege and responsibilities for processing the data.
2. Peer-To-Peer network is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers.
3. Peer-To-Peer network has no dedicated server.
4. Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a problem if the computer with the resource is down.

Client/Server Network:-

1. Client/Server network is a network model designed for the end users called clients, to access the resources such as songs, video, etc. from a central computer
known as Server.
2. The central controller is known as a server while all other computers in the network are called clients.
3. A server performs all the major operations such as security and network management.
4. A server is responsible for managing all the resources such as files, directories, printer, etc.
5. All the clients communicate with each other through a server. For example, if client1 wants to send some data to client 2, then it first sends the request to
the server for the permission. The server sends the response to the client 1 to initiate its communication with the client 2.
